            <p>
                Human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the workforce, emphasizing the need for tech professionals to adapt and evolve in the face of rapid technological advancements. As AI continues to integrate into various sectors, it brings about significant changes in economic growth and workforce productivity. This transformative technology, while offering numerous benefits, also poses challenges, particularly in terms of workforce displacement. According to Higginbotham, Weinberg, De La Rosa, Aaker, and Li (2020), there is a pressing need for a balanced approach that maximizes the benefits of AI while minimizing its adverse effects on employment.

                Human-centered AI focuses on creating systems that enhance human capabilities and ensure that the technology serves the broader interests of society. This approach involves designing AI systems that are transparent, fair, and accountable, which can help mitigate the negative impacts of workforce displacement. It encourages a collaborative interaction between humans and machines, where AI augments human skills rather than replaces them entirely.

                The impact of AI on economic growth is substantial, as it drives efficiency, innovation, and productivity across industries. However, this growth also comes with the challenge of ensuring that workers are not left behind. It is crucial for tech professionals to continuously update their skills and adapt to new roles that AI creates. Upskilling and reskilling programs are essential to equip the workforce with the necessary competencies to thrive in an AI-driven economy.

                Moreover, organizations must adopt strategies that support workforce transition, such as investing in employee training and development, promoting a culture of lifelong learning, and fostering an environment that embraces change. By focusing on human-centered AI, we can create a future where technology and human labor coexist harmoniously, driving economic growth while ensuring that the workforce remains productive and relevant. This balanced approach not only benefits businesses but also contributes to a more inclusive and sustainable economic landscape.
